 DIASEASE PREDICTION

Using Machine Learning, Logistic Regression and XGBoost to Predict Heart Failure

This model is used to predict  a disease using the symptoms which are given by patients or any user.
The system processes symptoms provided by the user as INPUT and gives the OUTPUT as probability of the disease.

My main objectives are; To reduce efforts taken by patients only to diagnose disease
                        To reduce patients death from late diagnosis 
 Machine learning uses past data for predicting by allowing you build models to get quickly cleaned  and process data and deliver results fast.
This process has three phases: Data Collection,Data Training and Testing.
I use this ML concept to track patientsâ€™ health

I can conclude that:
                   1.Healthcare issues can be solved efficiently by using machine learning
                   2.Doctors will make good decisions related to patient diagnosis, and there after offer good treatment.
                   3.Average prediction of about 80% is achieved thus a good model.
                   4.This system gives user friendly environment and is easy to use
                   5.As the system is based on the web application, the user is able to use it from anywhere and at any time
                   6.XGBoost gives a higher accuracy than Logistic Regression.With an Accuracy on Test data = 0.893(89%) and Accuracy on Test data= 0.8(80%) respectively
                   7.Lastly, the accuracy risk prediction depends on the diversity feature of the hospital data.
